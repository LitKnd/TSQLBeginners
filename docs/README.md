# TSQL for Beginners

This free course introduces you to the Transact SQL language implemented in SQL Server and takes you from newbie to a master of SELECT statements. Each "topic" of the course features a demo introducing a subject and a homework assignment to try on your own. The following topic goes over sample solutions for the homework previously assigned, then introduces a new subject with more homework.

The course covers:

* SELECT statements and aliasing tables
* Using WHERE clauses and JOINs
* Aggregating data using GROUP BY and CASE statements
* Common Table Expressions, Subqueries, and Derived tables
* Scalar and Table Valued User Defined Functions
* An introduction to Stored Procedure

## Audience

This course is intended for anyone who wants to learn TSQL. This could be database administrators, developers, business analysts, students, IT support staff, or anyone who is interested to learn a programming language where they can work with sets of data.

## Pre-requisites

To get started with the course, you will need to have a couple of applications installed. The course doesn't show how to install these tools, but jumps right in under the assumption that you have already installed them successfully.

- Microsoft SQL Server Developer Edition, which is [free from Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)
  * **Windows**: You probably want to click 'Download now' under where it says 'Developer'
  * **Mac**: You probably want to click "Choose your installation setup" under "Docker", which will eventually take you to this Quickstart page on how to [Run SQL Server container images with Docker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-docker)
- Either [Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio) or [SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms) (both of which are free as well). Most demos will be shown in Azure Data Studio.
  * **Windows**: Take your pick of either.
  * **Mac**: You want Azure Data Studio (SSMS is Windows-only)
