Look at the execution plan (CTRL+M for "actual" execution plan)
Execution plans are a map of how the query is run behind the scenes

You don't need to use these while you are learning TSQL! 
I will show them sometimes when discussing solutions simply to talk about how queries work
And maybe someday you will use these, seeing them as you learn makes them less mysterious

What are those Compute Scalars for?
And how can we learn more about them?
